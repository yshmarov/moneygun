  #
  # operation :process_image do
  #   costs 10.credits + 1.credit_per(:mb)

  #
  credit_pack :tiny do

  # Set to nil to disable low balance alerts

  # Handle low credit balance alerts â€“ Useful to sell booster credit packs, for example
  #
  # config.on_low_balance do |user|
  # Send notification to user when their balance drops below the threshold
  # UserMailer.low_credits_alert(user).deliver_later
  # end

  # For how long expiring credits from the previous fulfillment cycle will "overlap" the following fulfillment period.
  # During this time, old credits from the previous period will erroneously count as available balance.
  # But if we set this to 0 or nil, user balance will show up as zero some time until the next fulfillment cycle hits.
  # A good default is to match the frequency of your UsageCredits::FulfillmentJob
  # fulfillment_grace_period = 5.minutes

  #
  # Rounding strategy for credit calculations (default: :ceil)
  # :ceil - Always round up (2.1 => 3)
  # :floor - Always round down (2.9 => 2)
  # :round - Standard rounding (2.4 => 2, 2.6 => 3)

  # config.format_credits do |amount|
