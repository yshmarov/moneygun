Use the rules below when:

- You are writing HTML
- You are writing CSS
- You are writing styles in a JavaScript Stimulus controller

## Rules for AI (mandatory)

The codebase uses TailwindCSS v4.x (the newest version) with [daisyui.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/daisyui.mdc)

- Always prefer using DaisyUI components and colors when possible.
  - Example 1: use `bg-warning` rather than `bg-red-500`
- Never create new styles in [application.css](mdc:app/assets/tailwind/application.css) or [application.css](mdc:app/assets/stylesheets/application.css) without explicitly receiving permission to do so
- Always generate semantic HTML
